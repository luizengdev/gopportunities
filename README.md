This project is a modern job opportunities API built using Golang, currently one of the highest paying programming languages. The API is powered by Go-Gin as a router, GoORM for database communication, SQLite as the database, and Swagger for API documentation and testing. The project follows a modern package structure to keep the codebase organized and maintainable.

## Features

- Introduction to Golang and building modern APIs
- Development environment setup for creating the API
- Using Go-Gin as a router for route management
- Implementing SQLite as the database for the API
- Using GoORM for communication with the database
- Integrating Swagger for API documentation and testing
- Creating a modern package structure for organizing the project
- Implementing a complete job opportunities API with endpoints for searching, creating, editing, and deleting opportunities
- Implementing automated tests to ensure API quality

## Installation

To use this project, you need to follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `go mod download`
3. Build the application: `go build`
4. Run the application: `./main`

## Makefile Commands

The project includes a Makefile to help you manage common tasks more easily. Here's a list of the available commands and a brief description of what they do:

- `make run`: Run the application without generating API documentation.
- `make run-with-docs`: Generate the API documentation using Swag, then run the application.
- `make build`: Build the application and create an executable file named `gopportunities`.
- `make test`: Run tests for all packages in the project.
- `make docs`: Generate the API documentation using Swag.
- `make clean`: Remove the `gopportunities` executable and delete the `./docs` directory.

To use these commands, simply type `make` followed by the desired command in your terminal. For example:

```sh
make run
```
